This was a Newcastle Univeristy year-long Andorid app developement team project.
We have set out to design an app to allow anyone to create treasure hunts for any other user of the app.
The original concept was designed with new univerity students in mind to allow them to follow user created treasure hunt in order to femiliarise themselves with the University campus and to find new areas in a new city.
